# com.agava.merge2 
  
Unity package. Provides an API for creating games in the Merge 2 genre.  
Does not reference Unity Engine, so it could be used in a regular C# project.  
  
Make sure you have standalone [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed first. Reboot after installation.  
In Unity, open "Window" -> "Package Manager".  
Click the "+" sign on top left corner -> "Add package from git URL..."  
Paste this: `https://github.com/ArtemVetik/com.agava.merge2.git#1.0.0`
